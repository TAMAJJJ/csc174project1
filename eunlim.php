						<h3>Early Years</h3>
					</header>
					<p> I was born in Daegu, South Korea and moved to Ulsan. After 7 years in Ulsan, my parents decided to move to Busan for better education. I went elementary school and middle school in Busan then I told my parents that I want to study in the United States. In 2012, I left South Korea and started to study in Rhode Island. I met most of my good friends during that time.</p>
